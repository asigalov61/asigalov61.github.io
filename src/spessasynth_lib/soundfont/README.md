## This is the SoundFont2 parsing library.
The code here is responsible for parsing the SoundFont2 file and
providing an easy way to get the data out. 
Default modulators are also stored here (in `modulators.js`)

`read` folder contains the classes that represent the soundfont file

`write` folder contains the code for writing out an `.sf2` file.
